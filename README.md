# Expentrax - A Telegram Expense Tracking Bot

This project is a complete rewrite of my previous Telegram bot, Expentrax. The goal is to build it from scratch without the use of any AI tools, demonstrating a deeper understanding of the underlying concepts and code. This project is for CS50's final project.

## ðŸš§ Core Functionalities

This checklist outlines the essential features required for a minimum viable product.

- [ ] **User Management**: The bot can uniquely identify and manage individual users.

    - [ ] Implemented a database schema to store user information.

    - [ ] Handled user authentication and data persistence.

- [ ] **Transaction Logging**: The bot can parse and record expense messages.

    - [ ] Developed a robust string parsing function to extract amount, category, and description.

    - [ ] Integrated with a database to save transaction data.

- [ ] **Data Retrieval**: The bot can provide basic expense summaries.

    - [ ] Implemented a command to list recent transactions.

    - [ ] Implemented a command to show total expenses for a specific period (e.g., this month).

## âœ¨ "Wow" Factors

This checklist covers additional features to enhance the bot's functionality and demonstrate advanced skills.

- [ ] Interactive User Interface: The bot uses interactive elements.

    - [ ] Implemented custom keyboards for quick access to commands.

    - [ ] Added inline buttons for more dynamic interactions.

- [ ] Custom Category Management: Users can manage their own expense categories.

    - [ ] Created a dedicated database table for user-defined categories.

    - [ ] Developed commands to add, edit, and delete categories.

- [ ] Visual Reporting: The bot provides visual summaries of spending.

    - [ ] Integrated a plotting library (e.g., Matplotlib) to create charts.

    - [ ] The bot can send a visual report (e.g., a pie chart) of expenses by category.

- [ ] Recurring Transactions: The bot can handle recurring expenses.

    - [ ] Implemented a command to set up repeating transactions.

    - [ ] Developed a scheduling mechanism to automatically add recurring expenses to the database.

This checklist will serve as a clear roadmap for my development process and provide a great overview for anyone looking at this project.
